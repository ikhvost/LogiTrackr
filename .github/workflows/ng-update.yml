# We donâ€™t want to only update the Angular version mentioned in the package.json file using dependabot, but also go through the ng update process.
# Angular CLI provides an automated tool to scan our code and automatically apply the code changes during the update from one version to the next version.

# Merge the ng-update PR first and the other dependabot Angular update PRs will be automatically closed.
